## Hyperlane

### Prize Requirements

ðŸŽ¼ $2,000 - Best Interchain Application

An interchain application is an app that communicates between chains, it either transfers assets or has interchain function calls. The winner of this prize would be the most compelling application that leverages Hyperlane, and benefits from its presence on multiple chains!

ðŸ’¸ $2,000 - Best use of Hyperlane Warp Routes

Warp Routes are Hyperlaneâ€™s unique take on token bridging. They are unique and instanced expression of bridging as opposed to the traditional omnibus token bridge design. Each Warp Route can have its own security model, using Hyperlaneâ€™s Interchain Security Modules. Perhaps most importantly, Warp Routes are completely permissionless! No one can stop you from bringing whichever asset youâ€™d like to any chain youâ€™d like.

So how can you win this prize? While the only strict requirement is that you use Warp Routes in your submission, the more creative you get with it the better!
