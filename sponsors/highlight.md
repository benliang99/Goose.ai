### Please add a sentence or two on why you're applicable for this prize.

My team and I created the "Rotating Mr. Goose" Generative NFT Collection using Highlight. It references a meme on the r/uwaterloo subreddit on a rotating goose for everyday of the year. With Highlight, we are able to perform the rotation programatically as well as the background and scenery, making for an incredibly efficient and fun process for bringing the "Rotating Mr. Goose" meme on-chain, allowing anyone to be a part of r/uwaterloo history.

### Additional Feedback

Small hiccups with compressing the files instead of the directory, but was figured very quickly thanks for Nathaniel and Sarib's help! Everything else was super intuitive.
