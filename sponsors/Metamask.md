## MetaMask

### Prize Requirements

Connect with MetaMask SDK

### Please add a sentence or two on why you're applicable for this prize.

We are leveraging the Metamask SDK to allow users to add the Polygon Mainnet and Testnet (mumbai) chains to their MetaMask wallet with one click! Instead of having to google the correct chainId, chainName, blockExplorerUrl, nativeCurrency, and rpcURL and copy and paste each value over one by one.

We are also using MetaMask SDK to provide secure authentication login for our POAP minting webpage! (We don't want people or bots spamming our POAP minting and taking it away from genuine users)
