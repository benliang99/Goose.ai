### Please add a sentence or two on why you're applicable for this prize.

The Graph helps us lower the barrier of entry to data in Web3. We are leveraging The Graph to create data visualization dashboards for monitoring Gnosis Safe wallet's transactions, ownership status, creation date and more, as well as UMA Mainnet Voting Entities! We also answer questions about The Graph with our LLM-driven chatbot!

With the Gnosis Safe subgraph on The Graph, you can:
  - Find trends using our interactive plotting feature using data from an existing The Graph's Gnosis Safe subgraph
  - Enter your Gnosis Safe wallet address or transaction address to get information instantly
  - Download the data they select as a .csv

With the UMA Protocol subgraph on The Graph, you can:
  -  Find the users who vote the most
  -  Find the users who vote *correctly* the most
  -  Sort data by PriceRequest value
  -  Look up details about any individual user
