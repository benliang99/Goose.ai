# Sponsor Prize

## IPFS, Filecoin & more

### Prize Requirements

### Please add a sentence or two on why you're applicable for this prize.

We wanted to build off the inspiration Dieter gave my team during his talk at Pragma, where Dieter talked about the importance of backing up one's NFT metadata, especially if it is stored on centralized CDN servers (e.g. AWS Cloudfront, Cloudflare CDN). 

Goose.ai allows anyone to backup their NFTs on any chain through chat using IPFS and Web3.Storage API in seconds. No setup required.
