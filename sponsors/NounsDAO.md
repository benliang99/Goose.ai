# Sponsor Prize

## NounsDAO

### Prize Requirements

We invite developers, designers, product folks, and everyone else to team up for an entire weekend of building, creating, experimenting, innovating, and keeping Nouns weird. Hackers are encouraged to submit any project they believe will benefit the Nouns and web3 ecosystem. Make sure always to keep the Nounish vibe!

🏆 $3,000 - Best Public Good

🎨 $2,000 - Best Nouns Artwork Use

### Please add a sentence or two on why you're applicable for this prize.

We are using Nouns artwork to generate unique POAPs for 650+ ETHWaterloo hackers! Hackers are able to choose from a Noun unique to the wallet address they connected that they used to stake for ETHWaterloo, and the Noun is obtained using the Nouns-API.
