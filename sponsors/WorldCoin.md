We are leveraging WorldCoin's World ID to provide secure authentication login for our POAP minting webpage! (We don't want people spamming)

Furthermore, we have created a WorldCoin assistant using OpenAI to answer everything related to WorldCoin, stemming from our fascination with the orb and what it does after reading through the FAQ.
